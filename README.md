A multi-layered two-stream scheme for vegetation with vertically varying properties.

Uses the Meador and Weavor two-stream equations to calculate the optical properties of individual layers and then the formalism of adding to combine them. If the canopy is vertically homogeneous the results are numerically identical to the Sellers' two-stream model.
